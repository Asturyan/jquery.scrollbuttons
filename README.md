Similar plugins
===============

This plugin is similar to the jquery.scrollable plugin. Differences are:

-   This plugin does not provide a customized scrollbar, but only
    buttons for scrolling.
-   With this plugin, scrolling with buttons is smoth, while with the
    jquery.scrollable plugin the scrolling with buttons happens stepwise.
-   This plugin does not affect scrolling with the mouswheel while this
    is switched off by default when using the jquery.scrollable plugin.



Please help to improve this plugin

Usage of this plugin should be very simple.
However, for sure that there are situations where this plugin fails
or is difficult to use.
