jquery.scrollbuttons
====================

Scroll with javascript using buttons instead of the scollbar.

This plugin is similar to the jquery.scrollable plugin. Differences are:

-   This plugin does not provide a customized scrollbar, but only
    buttons for scrolling.
-   With this plugin, scrolling with buttons is smoth, while with the
    jquery.scrollable plugin the scrolling with buttons happens stepwise.
-   This plugin does not affect scrolling with the mouswheel while this
    is switched off by default when using the jquery.scrollable plugin.
